THE SKY
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I saw a shadow on the ground
</p>
<p>
And heard a bluejay going by;
</p>
<p>
A shadow went across the ground,
</p>
<p>
And I looked up and saw the sky.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It hung up on the poplar tree,
</p>
<p>
But while I looked it did not stay;
</p>
<p>
It gave a tiny sort of jerk
</p>
<p>
And moved a little bit away.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And farther on and farther on
</p>
<p>
It moved and never seemed to stop.
</p>
<p>
I think it must be tied with chains
</p>
<p>
And something pulls it from the top.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It never has come down again,
</p>
<p>
And every time I look to see,
</p>
<p>
The sky is always slipping back
</p>
<p>
And getting far away from me.

THE CORNFIELD
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I went across the pasture lot
</p>
<p>
When not a one was watching me.
</p>
<p>
Away beyond the cattle barns
</p>
<p>
I climbed a little crooked tree.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And I could look down on the field
</p>
<p>
And see the corn and how it grows
</p>
<p>
Across the world and up and down
</p>
<p>
In very straight and even rows.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And far away and far away&#8212;
</p>
<p>
I wonder if the farmer man
</p>
<p>
Knows all about the corn and how
</p>
<p>
It comes together like a fan.

MILKING TIME

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When supper time is almost come,
</p>
<p>
But not quite here, I cannot wait,
</p>
<p>
And so I take my china mug
</p>
<p>
And go down by the milking gate.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The cow is always eating shucks
</p>
<p>
And spilling off the little silk.
</p>
<p>
Her purple eyes are big and soft&#8212;
</p>
<p>
She always smells like milk.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And Father takes my mug from me,
</p>
<p>
And then he makes the stream come out.
</p>
<p>
I see it going in my mug
</p>
<p>
And foaming all about.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And when it's piling very high,
</p>
<p>
And when some little streams commence
</p>
<p>
To run and drip along the sides,
</p>
<p>
He hands it to me through the fence.

IN MY PILLOW
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When Mother or Father turns down the light,
</p>
<p>
I like to look into my pillow at night.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Some people call them dreams, but for me
</p>
<p>
They are things I look down in my pillow and see.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I saw some birds, as many as four,
</p>
<p>
That were all blue wings and nothing else more.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Without any head and without any feet,
</p>
<p>
Just blue wings flying over a street.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And almost every night I see
</p>
<p>
A little brown bowl that can talk to me,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A nice little bowl that laughs and sings,
</p>
<p>
And ever so many other things.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sometimes they are plainer than I can say,
</p>
<p>
And while I am waking they go away.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And when nobody is coming by,
</p>
<p>
I feel my pillow all over and try
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And try to feel the pretty things,
</p>
<p>
The little brown bowl and the flying wings.

MISS KATE-MARIE

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And it was Sunday everywhere,
</p>
<p>
And Father pinned a rose on me
</p>
<p>
And said he guessed he'd better take
</p>
<p>
Me down to see Miss Kate-Marie.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And when I went it all turned out
</p>
<p>
To be a Sunday school, and there
</p>
<p>
Miss Kate-Marie was very good
</p>
<p>
And let me stand beside her chair.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her hat was made of yellow lace;
</p>
<p>
Her dress was very soft and thin,
</p>
<p>
And when she talked her little tongue
</p>
<p>
Was always wriggling out and in.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I liked to smell my pretty rose;
</p>
<p>
I liked to feel her silky dress.
</p>
<p>
She held a very little book
</p>
<p>
And asked the things for us to guess.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She asked about Who-made-y-God,
</p>
<p>
And never seemed to fuss or frown;

<p>
I liked to watch her little tongue
</p>
<p>
And see it wriggle up and down.

THE WOODPECKER

<p>
The woodpecker pecked out a little round hole
</p>
<p>
And made him a house in the telephone pole.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
One day when I watched he poked out his head,

<p>
And he had on a hood and a collar of red.

He can snuggle back in the telephone pole.

All through the garden I went and went,

And I walked in under the butterbean tent.

<div class="stanza">
<p>
The poles leaned up like a good tepee
</p>

And made a nice little house for me.

I had a hard brown clod for a seat,

And all outside was a cool green street.

A little green worm and a butterfly

Our brother Clarence goes to school.

He has a slate and a blue school-bag.

He has a book and a copybook

And a scholar's companion and a little slate rag.

He knows a boy named Joe B. Kirk,

<p>
And how to make a football out of a hat.

We climb up on the fence and gate

On Sunday morning, then he comes

The blacking and the toilet soap

No matter&#8212;that's what Father said.

DICK AND WILL

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Our brother says that Will was born
</p>
<p>
The very day that Dickie came;
</p>
<p>
When one is four the other is,
</p>
<p>
And all their birthdays are the same.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Their coats and waists are just alike;
</p>
<p>
They have their hats together, too.
</p>
<p>
They sleep together in one bed,
</p>
<p>
And Will can put on Dickie's shoe.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But they are not the same at all;
</p>
<p>
Two different boys they have to be,
</p>
<p>
For Dick can play in Mother's room
</p>
<p>
When Will is climbing in a tree.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Or maybe Will is on the porch
</p>
<p>
To cry because he stubbed his toe,
</p>
<p>
And Dick is laughing by the gate
</p>
<p>
And watching ants go in a row.

I'm sitting on a little chair.

For something that is gone.

LITTLE RAIN

When I was making myself a game

Up in the garden, a little rain came.

It fell down quick in a sort of rush,

And I crawled back under the snowball bush.

He had just a very few feathers on.

He shivered a little under his skin,

<p>
And then he shut his eyeballs in.

Even after the rain had begun to hush

It kept on raining up in the bush.

One big flat drop came sliding down,

I wonder if

have a cat

And say some kind of little prayers.

I saw them in the stones that make
</p>
<p>
A church, and in a bridge.
</p>
<p>
They're hidden in the solid rock
</p>
<p>
But they show along the edge.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
You see them in foundation stones;
</p>
<p>
They show in creeks and waterfalls;
</p>
<p>
And once I saw them on the jail&#8212;
</p>
<p>
More little shells in walls.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We walk on them when we walk on roads;
</p>
<p>
And they're packed under all the hills.
</p>
<p>
Suppose the sea should come back here
</p>
<p>
And gather up its shells.

HORSE

<div class="stanza">
<p>
His bridle hung around the post.
</p>
<p>
The sun and the leaves made spots come down;
</p>
<p>
I looked close at him through the fence;
</p>
<p>
The post was drab and he was brown.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
His nose was long and hard and still,
</p>
<p>
And on his lip were specks like chalk.
</p>
<p>
But once he opened up his eyes,
</p>
<p>
And he began to talk.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He didn't talk out with his mouth;
</p>
<p>
He didn't talk with words or noise.
</p>
<p>
The talk was there along his nose;
</p>
<p>
It seemed and then it was.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He said the day was hot and slow,
</p>
<p>
And he said he didn't like the flies;
</p>
<p>
They made him have to shake his skin,
</p>
<p>
And they got drowned in his eyes.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He said that drab was just about
</p>
<p>
The same as brown, but he was not
</p>
<p>
A post, he said, to hold a fence.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I'm horse,&#34; he said, &#34;that's what!&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And then he shut his eyes again.
</p>
<p>
As still as they had been before.
</p>
<p>
He said for me to run along
</p>
<p>
And not to bother him any more.

AUGUST NIGHT

We had to wait for the heat to pass,
</p>
<p>
And I was lying on the grass,
</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>
While Mother sat outside the door,
</p>
<p>
And I saw how many stars there were.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Beyond the tree, beyond the air,
</p>
<p>
And more and more were always there.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
So many that I think they must
</p>
<p>
Be sprinkled on the sky like dust.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A dust is coming through the sky!
</p>
<p>
And I felt myself begin to cry.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
So many of them and so small,
</p>
<p>
Suppose I cannot know them all.

THREE DOMINICAN NUNS

<p>
One day they came; I heard their feet.
</p>
<p>
They made a tapping on the street.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And as they passed before our trees,
</p>
<p>
Their shawls blew out in curves like threes,
</p>
<p>
And bent again in twos and L's;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The wind blew on their rosaries
</p>
<p>
And made them ring like little bells.

MY HEART

My heart is beating up and down,

Is walking like some heavy feet.

<p>
My heart is going every day,

<p>
And I can hear it jump and beat.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
At night before I go to sleep,
</p>
<p>
I feel it beating in my head;

<p>
I hear it jumping in my neck
</p>
<p>
And in the pillow on my bed.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And then I make some little words
</p>
<p>
To go along and say with it&#8212;

THE HENS

<div class="stanza">
<p>
The night was coming very fast;
</p>
<p>
It reached the gate as I ran past.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The pigeons had gone to the tower of the church
</p>
<p>
And all the hens were on their perch,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Up in the barn, and I thought I heard
</p>
<p>
A piece of a little purring word.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I stopped inside, waiting and staying,
</p>
<p>
To try to hear what the hens were saying.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
They were asking something, that was plain,
</p>
<p>
Asking it over and over again.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
One of them moved and turned around,
</p>
<p>
Her feathers made a ruffled sound,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A ruffled sound, like a bushful of birds,
</p>
<p>
And she said her little asking words.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She pushed her head close into her wing,
</p>
<p>
But nothing answered anything.
